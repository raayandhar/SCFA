    "## What if we make the random projection hashable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by [HashAttention: Semantic Sparsity for Faster Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14468) by Aditya Desai et al.\n",
    "### Random hashing:\n",
    "\n",
    "We hash $Q$ and $K$ into $B$ buckets by using a random matrix $R \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times b/2}$ and taking $\\argmax([xR; âˆ’xR])$. As per the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, this maps $Q$ and $K$ into a $b/2$-dimensional space in a relative-distance preserving way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively, our vector $\\vec{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is projected to hash vector $\\vec{x}_h \\in \\mathbb{R}^{b/2}$, and we take its dimension with the largest component as the hash index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learnable hashing:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can learn its own hash functions that cluster together attendant queries/keys based on semantic similarity rather than vector distance (e.g this does processing work). We want to encourage two things:\n",
    "1. Downstream performance\n",
    "2. Balancing loss (to prevent degenerate solutions where all q/ks are mapped to the same hash index)\n",
    "    a. Entropy regularization?\n",
    "    b. Regularization on projection matrix (L1) to prevent one dim from dominating?"
